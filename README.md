Lefein (Kotlin)
===============

This is a very small toy project I created to play around with and learn a bit more about how the data in the
Final Fantasy 1 (NES) ROM is put together.

It's unlikely this version of the project will get much further, but I'm sharing what I wrote in case anyone
else is curious how one _could_ build something like this.

The name, unfortunately, won't make much sense for how this project went, but it (hopefully) will fit when it's
rewritten in a language I feel is more suitable for dealing with the data types.

### Data

Data for offsets/translation tables provided by:

- [Final Fantasy 1 Disassembly](https://github.com/Entroper/FF1Disassembly) by Disch
- FFHackster by Disch
- Help from the [Final Fantasy Randomizer](http://finalfantasyrandomizer.com/) Community
